Pure Java Script Advanced Course

This is my first time working with WEBPACK.
I started the project in November 2020 and I couldn't find something about WEBPACK 5.6.0 working correctly on the net.
Only official documentation and more than 100500+ comments on different forums and sites from different people about BUGS in the "new 5 webpack".
  Messages stating that "HMR is not working"!
  Or "webpack-dev-server" is the wrong script!
  And, of course, my favorites - "the official documentation was written like shit" and something like that.
It took me 3 days to figure out how it works.
Hope my experience will help you
